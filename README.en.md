# Lingcoo TS Fastify Business Starter

A modular business application workspace built with native Fastify, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Drizzle, React, Ant Design, and pnpm.

It provides API and Worker entry points, an independent Ant Design Admin, a separately built Web placeholder, framework-neutral Contracts and API Client packages, migrations, Docker, CI, quality gates, and a module generator. Common modules are implemented one at a time without shipping product or industry domains.

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev
```

Run `pnpm check` for the local quality gate and `pnpm e2e` for desktop/mobile Admin acceptance. See the Chinese [README](README.md) and the documents under `docs/` for the architecture and delivery conventions.
